# TrevorSystems-ASP.NET-MVC

This project is the repository that was built in order to manage my personal website project.

I expect that this website will eventually be used as a portfolio, but for now it is just a fun project.

I hope to add my github repo into the website somehow, a system that allows my friends and I to transfer files of any size, and some sort of in-browser game all in the website.

Goodluck future me!
